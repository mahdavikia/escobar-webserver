# Escobar Webserver Project
### ------------ Why Escobar? --------------
#### This code was developed while I was re-watching Narcos. The names of Escobar, Cali, Madeleine and Los Pepes are borrowed from this series :)
#### This program uses the socket programming method; It creates a web server and has limitations. First, it only responds to GET requests and does not take any parameters. Second, it is designed only for static HTML pages. Definitely, by developing this-
#### code, many features can be added to it.
#### It is necessary to explain that the development of this code was done by studying open sources available on the Internet.
